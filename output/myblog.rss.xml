<title>Elasticsearch Docker Requirements (for Playing Around)</title>  <description><![CDATA[<p>Two days later, I'm writing this to remind myself of a few things in my docker playground setup.</p>

<h2>If You Get a Licensing Error in Kibana, Check Docker to See If Elasticsearch Is Still Running</h2>

<p>Kibana will default to some imaginary Elasticsearch instance<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup> that it can't reach. I do know that part of this is to check for licensing (even if you are using the free license). This is why you may see the error <code>{"statusCode":503,"error":"Service Unavailable","message":"License is not available."}</code></p>

<p>Elasticsearch containers don't just turn off on their own for no reason so this usually means there is another issue which I will point to in the next step.</p>

<h2>If Your Setup Keeps Crashing, You May Need to Increase the Resources That Docker Can Utilize</h2>

<p>Elasticsearch Enterprise Search is a little resources intensive. Sometimes my eyes miss the warning in the <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/enterprise-search/current/docker.html#docker-compose-example">Running Enterprise Search with Docker Compose</a> section that you should be allocating at least 4GB RAM.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Make sure Docker Engine is allotted at least 4GiB of memory. In Docker Desktop, you configure resource usage on the Advanced tab in Preference (macOS) or Settings (Windows).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To adjust via the GUI (macOS):</p>

<ol>
<li>Select <em>Settings</em> gear in the top corner</li>
<li>Select <em>Resources</em> menu option</li>
<li>Select the <em>Advanced</em> submenu</li>
<li>Adjust memory to <em>at least</em> 4GB.</li>
</ol>

<p>TODO: Learn what this default instance is and why it exists. Maybe also figure out how to sound the alarm when Kibana is trying to reach it!&#160;<a href="#fnref-1" class="footnoteBackLink" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">&#8617;</a></p>
