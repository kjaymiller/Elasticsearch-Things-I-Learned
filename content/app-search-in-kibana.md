The biggest thing in 7.15 is Enterprise Search and the crawler coming to GA. For me that means App Search felt more at home in Kibana.

App search looks cleaner in Kibana. Text seems larger and more fitting into the Elastic Stack.

There was also the idea of grouped engines which gives me the index pattern vibes. I really thing I'm going to be able to build some hacky (good) systems with Enterprise search.
